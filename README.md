# Utkikk9000
This repository was created as a part of my Bachelor thesis, during my time at The Royal Norwegian Naval Academy. 
The thesis consists of a Computer Vision application for classifying ships, as well as their relative heading to the observer.
As I am Norwegian, the thesis-document is written in Norwegian, however all of the code and scripts should be understandable for non-norwegian speakers.

The production of the application relied heavily on AlexeyAB's version of [Darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)
